# CombineBot Privacy Policy
CombineBot does not track much data.  The data that it does track if information that is required for the bot to function and deliver certain features.  CombineBot receives information from Discord such as:
* Command Execution
    * User information
        * User Name
        * User Avatar
    * Additional metadata as required to execute commands or deliver features.

In addition to this, when you choose to report an error in the bot to CombineSoldier14 by pressing the *"Report Error"* button, you agree to send information regarding the error to the bot maintainer, including
* Stack Traces
* Full Error Information
* Any arguments that were passed into the command that caused an error

## Selling Data
Data is not sold.  Period.  Anonymous information is put in the bot console, and is used for debugging purposes, and to ensure the quality of CombineBot.  This anonymous information is seen by people who manage the physical on-premises server on which CombineBot resides.

CombineBot does share some information with the APIs that it uses to function, things like certain command arguments can be shared with them in order to get data.

CombineBot uses reasonable measures to secure collected data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

If you have any questions or concerns, please create a GitHub issue on the [CombineBot repository](https://github.com/CombineSoldier14/CombineBot).
