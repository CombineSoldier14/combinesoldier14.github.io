# About Me
My name is **CombineSoldier14**. I have an interest in computers, games, and technology. I know these programming languages:
* Python
* Java/TypeScript
* HTML/CSS
* C++
* some Rust/C#

I code various projects and own the Geometry Dash creating team [CMBTeam](https://discord.gg/xz47V9Kvm7). I love video games and I am a fan mainly of Half-Life and Ace Attorney.

I am the creator of CombineBot, a free and open source easy to use discord bot with over 30+ slash commands.
